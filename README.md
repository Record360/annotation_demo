# 🎨 Annotation Demo

hey! this is a quick proof of concept for the future of the **damage circle annotation project** 🔴✏️

## what is this?

basically we're exploring what image annotation could look like for marking up equipment damage photos. think circles, arrows, highlights - all the good stuff you'd want when documenting issues on heavy equipment 🚜💥

## features

- 🖱️ select/move annotations around
- ✏️ freehand drawing for quick marks
- ⭕ circles to highlight damage areas
- ⬜ rectangles for boxing things in
- ➡️ arrows to point at specific spots
- 📝 text labels
- 🌟 highlight tool (semi-transparent marker)
- 💾 "burn" annotations into the image and save as new file (original stays untouched!)

## tech

using [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/) for the canvas magic - it's a solid library for this kind of thing

## try it out

👉 **[Live Demo](https://record360.github.io/annotation_demo/)** 👈

just pick an image (or upload your own), draw some annotations, and hit save. that's it!

## status

🚧 **this is a demo/proof of concept** 🚧

not production code - just exploring the idea and seeing what's possible. feedback welcome!
